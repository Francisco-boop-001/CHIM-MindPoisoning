# World of Drama-Llama — Francisco's CHIM Plugins

Skyrim already has dragons, a civil war and Nazeem. Naturally, it also needed gossip with consequences and NPC conversations that are not automatically about you. You're welcome. Condolences.

**World of Drama-Llama** is a small family of CHIM server plugins for private scenes, spoken reflection, NPC promises and changing opinions. The emo llama supervises. Its qualifications remain disputed.

## Pick your particular disaster

### Mind Poisoning 0.1.18 — PRE-ALPHA

When A tells B something about C, B may reconsider their opinion of C. For example, Aela might tell Lydia that Nazeem is arrogant; Lydia can agree, disagree or change her mind. Praise, criticism, a balanced account or no change can all be valid outcomes; gossip is not shared world truth.

It also supports Player-origin input, an opinion dashboard in CHIM Plugin Manager → Plugin Page, and optional overhearing. Overhearing is off by default and can evaluate up to four eligible NPCs alongside the addressed listener in one model call. Version 0.1.18 improves compatibility with empty relationship maps and legacy Player aliases.

### Private Conversation 0.1.15 — PRE-ALPHA

Stage a pair, a group of 2–4, a free scene, or one solo response. For example, choose Aela and Lydia on the Private Conversation page, arm the scene, then send a Standard-mode direction in Skyrim. Arming alone does not start dialogue. Voice-friendly “wrap up” and “end scene” phrases close scenes. Scene direction works without Mind Poisoning. When installed, Mind Poisoning can evaluate eligible dialogue acknowledgements and registered solo reflections for opinion effects. Scene scope does not enforce physical earshot or erase retained memories.

### Sworn & Scorned 0.1.5 — PRE-ALPHA

Sworn & Scorned tracks NPC-owned promises and grievances. For example, an NPC's promise to help another with a problem can remain as an issue; if it is open and unmuted, it may provide one short reminder in a later eligible conversation. The model chooses whether to mention it; no confrontation or recognition of a particular quest or item is guaranteed. Qualifying outcomes can also affect the NPC owner's CHIM opinion of the counterpart.

It starts disabled. Enable it and choose a cast of up to eight NPCs. PHP CLI workers are required. CHIM's relationship evaluator is the default; Jev's experimental decision evaluator is optional, off by default, and does not generate dialogue.

## How they fit together

These are separate CHIM server plugins; install only the ones you want. Private Conversation does not require Mind Poisoning for scene direction. With both installed, Mind Poisoning can evaluate eligible Private Conversation dialogue acknowledgements and registered solo reflections for opinion effects. Sworn & Scorned works with CHIM on its own; it can coexist with Mind Poisoning but does not send its lifecycle decisions through it.

None needs an extra ESP/ESL or Papyrus companion. Sworn & Scorned does require PHP CLI workers. Check each tagged guide for setup details. Opinion changes concern CHIM affinity, not Skyrim's vanilla relationship ranks.

## Install carefully

Use one route for each plugin on a server. Replace older enabled packages; do not stack versions or mix competing sync and Plugin Manager sources. Follow the version-specific guide and confirm the installed version in CHIM Plugin Manager. For upgrades from the former CHIM-Plugins collection install, see the [deployment and migration guide](docs/deployment-migration.md).

CHIM stores relationship data on the server. A separate Skyrim save or MO2 profile does not isolate that database, and removing a plugin does not undo its stored data. Use a separate CHIM server/database for testing.

## Support

For Mind Poisoning, open CHIM Plugin Manager → Plugin Page → Logs → Download filtered plugin log. For Private Conversation, follow its [tagged logging guide](https://github.com/Francisco-boop-001/CHIM-PrivateConversation/blob/private_conversation-v0.1.15/docs/logging-revision-2.md); for Sworn & Scorned, follow its [tagged guide](https://github.com/Francisco-boop-001/CHIM-SwornAndScorned/blob/sworn_and_scorned-v0.1.5/README.md). Each plugin has its own logging instructions.

For a useful report, include installed plugin versions, CHIM/client revision if known, relevant settings, reproduction steps, and expected versus observed behavior. Omit credentials and full private conversation dumps. Mind Poisoning's optional debug rationale can contain sensitive context, so review it before sharing.

Historical reports include [Mind Poisoning 0.1.10 Player-origin cases](tasks/live-acceptance-v0.1.10.md) and [user-reported Mind Poisoning NPC pair-path observations collected during Private Conversation scenes](tasks/reflection-reply-cap-2026-10-02.md). They describe specific cases and versions, not general gameplay reliability for either plugin. No current gameplay acceptance is claimed here for Sworn & Scorned.
